Moonfin is a cross-platform media client built with Flutter, designed for Jellyfin and Emby users who want a modern, customizable experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

## Supported Servers

| Server | Minimum Version | Status |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Jellyfin | 10.8.0+ | Full support |
| Emby | 4.8.0.0+ | Full support |

## Features & Enhancements

### Mobile + Desktop Experience
- Optimized for phones, tablets, and desktop environments from one Flutter codebase
- Responsive navigation patterns tuned for touch on mobile and larger layouts on desktop
- Platform-specific build/release scripts for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Playback Engine - libmpv via media_kit
All video and audio playback is powered by [media_kit](https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit) (libmpv) across every platform. This gives Moonfin broad codec coverage without relying on platform-specific media frameworks:

| Category | Supported Formats |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Video** | H.264, HEVC (H.265), VP8, VP9, AV1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, VC-1 |
| **Audio** | AAC, MP3, FLAC, Opus, Vorbis, AC3 (Dolby Digital), EAC3 (Dolby Digital Plus), DTS, TrueHD, PCM (16-/24-bit), ALAC |
| **Containers** | MP4, MKV, WebM, AVI, MOV, TS / M2TS, WMV / ASF |
| **Subtitles** | SRT, ASS / SSA, VTT / WebVTT, TTML, SUB; bitmap (PGS, DVB, VobSub) on desktop |
| **HDR** | Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG - automatic detection and signaling |
| **HW Accel** | VA-API, QSV, NVENC, VideoToolbox, V4L2, RKMPP |

### Downloads - Original or Transcoded
Media can be downloaded in its **original format** (bit-for-bit copy) or **server-transcoded** to a smaller file before saving. Transcoded downloads use **HEVC (H.265) video + AAC audio in an MP4 container**, which delivers roughly 50% smaller files compared to H.264 at equivalent perceived quality.

| Preset | Resolution | Video Bitrate | Audio Bitrate | Est. Size/hr |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Original | Source | Source | Source | Varies |
| High | 1080p | 4 Mbps | 192 kbps | ~1.8 GB |
| Medium | 720p | 2 Mbps | 128 kbps | ~950 MB |
| Low | 480p | 1 Mbps | 96 kbps | ~490 MB |
| Mobile | 360p | 500 kbps | 64 kbps | ~250 MB |

Downloaded files are organized automatically:
```
Movies/{Title (Year)}/
TV/{Series}/Season NN/
Music/{Artist}/{Album}/
Audiobooks/{Author}/{Collection}/
Books/{BookName}/
```

Resume position tracking, offline subtitle support, and full playback controls work identically for downloaded content.

### Ebook & Audiobook Support
**Ebooks** - Read EPUB, MOBI, AZW/AZW3, and PDF directly in-app. Comic archives (CBZ, CBR, CB7, CBT) render with two-page spread on desktop, zoom/pan, and page caching. Reader themes include Light, Dark, and Sepia.

**Audiobooks** - Play M4B and multi-file audiobooks with chapter navigation, position bookmarks, and resume tracking. Download entire audiobooks for offline listening with the same quality presets as video.

Books and audiobooks download in their **original format** - no transcoding.
