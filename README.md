> **[← Back to main Moonfin project](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client)**

Moonfin is a cross-platform media client built with Flutter, designed for Jellyfin and Emby users who want a modern, customizable experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

## Supported Servers

| Server | Minimum Version | Status |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Jellyfin | 10.8.0+ | Full support |
| Emby | 4.8.0.0+ | Full support |

## Platform Support

| Platform | Minimum Version | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Android** | 6.0 (API 23) | Full support |
| **iOS** | 13.0 | Full support |
| **macOS** | 10.15 (Catalina) | Full support |
| **Windows** | 10 | Full support |
| **Linux** | GTK 3 + CMake 3.13+ | Full support |

## Features & Enhancements

### Mobile + Desktop Experience
- Optimized for phones, tablets, and desktop environments from one Flutter codebase
- Responsive navigation patterns tuned for touch on mobile and larger layouts on desktop
- Platform-specific build/release scripts for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Playback Engine - libmpv via media_kit
All video and audio playback is powered by [media_kit](https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit) (libmpv) across every platform. This gives Moonfin broad codec coverage without relying on platform-specific media frameworks:

| Category | Supported Formats |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Video** | H.264, HEVC (H.265), VP8, VP9, AV1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, VC-1 |
| **Audio** | AAC, MP3, FLAC, Opus, Vorbis, AC3 (Dolby Digital), EAC3 (Dolby Digital Plus), DTS, TrueHD, PCM (16-/24-bit), ALAC |
| **Containers** | MP4, MKV, WebM, AVI, MOV, TS / M2TS, WMV / ASF |
| **Subtitles** | SRT, ASS / SSA, VTT / WebVTT, TTML, SUB; bitmap (PGS, DVB, VobSub) on desktop |
| **HDR** | Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG - automatic detection and signaling |
| **HW Accel** | VA-API, QSV, NVENC, VideoToolbox, V4L2, RKMPP |

### Downloads - Original or Transcoded
Media can be downloaded in its **original format** (bit-for-bit copy) or **server-transcoded** to a smaller file before saving. Transcoded downloads use **HEVC (H.265) video + AAC audio in an MP4 container**, which delivers roughly 50% smaller files compared to H.264 at equivalent perceived quality.

| Preset | Resolution | Video Bitrate | Audio Bitrate | Est. Size/hr |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Original | Source | Source | Source | Varies |
| High | 1080p | 4 Mbps | 192 kbps | ~1.8 GB |
| Medium | 720p | 2 Mbps | 128 kbps | ~950 MB |
| Low | 480p | 1 Mbps | 96 kbps | ~490 MB |
| Mobile | 360p | 500 kbps | 64 kbps | ~250 MB |

Downloaded files are organized automatically:
```
Movies/{Title (Year)}/
TV/{Series}/Season NN/
Music/{Artist}/{Album}/
Audiobooks/{Author}/{Collection}/
Books/{BookName}/
```
Android  downloads are saved under the app's external storage directory `(Android/data/com.moonfin.app/files/Moonfin/)`. This uses getExternalStorageDirectory(), which provides more space than internal app storage and avoids counting against the device's internal storage quota. If external storage is unavailable, it falls back to the app's internal documents directory.

iOS downloads are saved under the app's Documents directory `(Documents/Moonfin/)`. This is the standard sandboxed location iOS provides for user-generated content. Files here are included in iCloud/iTunes backups by default and persist across app updates.

Desktop downloads are saved under the application support directory by default, but users can configure a custom download path in settings.

Resume position tracking, offline subtitle support, and full playback controls work identically for downloaded content.

### Ebook & Audiobook Support
**Ebooks** - Read EPUB, MOBI, AZW/AZW3, and PDF directly in-app. Comic archives (CBZ, CBR, CB7, CBT) render with two-page spread on desktop, zoom/pan, and page caching. Reader themes include Light, Dark, and Sepia.

**Audiobooks** - Play M4B and multi-file audiobooks with chapter navigation, position bookmarks, and resume tracking. Download entire audiobooks for offline listening with the same quality presets as video.

Books and audiobooks download in their **original format** - no transcoding.

### Casting and Session Control

- Playback controls with track selection, delay adjustments, and picture-in-picture support
- Queue/next-up behavior that works across local and remote playback states

### Integrated Admin Panel

### Featured Media Bar
- Rotating featured hero content on the home screen with rich backdrop presentation
- Includes quick-glance metadata like ratings, genres, runtime, and overview
- Designed to highlight trending and library content without leaving the home flow

### SyncPlay

## Custom mpv.conf Configuration (Desktop)

Moonfin allows power users to fine-tune playback behavior using a custom `mpv.conf` file. This enables advanced options like custom shaders, video scaling algorithms, tone mapping, and more.

### Setup

1. **Enable Custom mpv.conf** — Go to **Settings → Playback → Advanced mpv** and toggle **Enable Custom mpv.conf** to on.

2. **Specify File Location** — Provide a path to your `mpv.conf` file:
   - Click **Custom mpv.conf Path** to browse or enter the path manually.
   - Moonfin will automatically check for `mpv.conf` in standard locations if not specified:
     - Application support directory (recommended)
     - Current working directory

3. **Example File Locations**
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Moonfin/mpv.conf` or `/home/user/.local/share/Moonfin/mpv.conf`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Moonfin/mpv.conf`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Moonfin\mpv.conf`

### File Size Limit

Configuration files must not exceed **256 KB**. Larger files are rejected.

### Allowed and Blocked Options

**Protected Options** — These affect core playback and are not configurable:
- `aid`, `sid`, `vid` (audio/subtitle/video selection)
- `sub-visibility`, `sub-ass`, `sub-ass-override` (subtitle rendering)
- `sub-delay`, `audio-delay` (sync controls)
- `network-timeout`, `sub-fonts-dir`, `sub-font` (core behavior)

**Blocked Options** — These are blocked for security:
- `script`, `scripts`, `script-opts`, `load-scripts` (script execution)
- `include`, `profile`, `input-conf` (config file manipulation)
- `input-ipc-server` (IPC access)

**Allowed Options** (Basic & Advanced scaling, rendering):
- Scaling: `scale`, `cscale`, `dscale`, `scale-*` options
- Rendering: `sigmoid-upscaling`, `deband`, `deband-*`, `interpolation`, `tscale`, `video-sync`
- Color & tone: `tone-mapping`, `tone-mapping-param`, `target-trc`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `saturation`, `gamma`, `sharpen`
- Audio: `audio-channels`, `audio-normalize-downmix`
- Effects: `deinterlace`, `keep-open`
- GLSL shaders: `glsl-shader*` (loading custom shaders)

### Unsafe Advanced Mode

Enable **Unsafe Advanced mpv Options** to unlock lower-level settings:
- `vo` (video output driver)
- `gpu-context` (GPU backend selection)
- `hwdec` (hardware decoding mode)
- `vf`, `af` (custom video/audio filters)
- `vd-lavc-*` (decoder options)
- `demuxer-*` and `cache-*` (stream behavior)

**Warning**: These options can break playback or cause instability if misconfigured.

### Example Configuration

```ini
# Scaling and rendering
scale=lanczos
deband=yes
tone-mapping=hdr

# Video sync and interpolation
video-sync=display-resample
interpolation=yes

# Shaders (if using unsafe advanced)
# glsl-shader=/path/to/shader.glsl
